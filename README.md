## 📖 Project Overview

This comprehensive data science project analyzes Walmart sales data across multiple stores to uncover business insights, performance patterns, and strategic recommendations. The analysis includes detailed store-by-store performance evaluation, seasonal trends, holiday impact assessment, and external factors correlation.

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- **Store Performance Analysis**: Individual assessment of each store's sales metrics
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Identification of seasonal trends and optimal periods
- **Holiday Impact**: Quantification of holiday sales lift and effectiveness
- **External Factors**: Correlation analysis with temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment
- **Business Intelligence**: Actionable insights and strategic recommendations

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains **6,435 records** across multiple Walmart stores with the following features:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `Store_Number` | int64 | Unique store identifier |
| `Date` | object | Week ending date |
| `Weekly_Sales` | object | Weekly sales amount ($) |
| `Holiday_Flag` | int64 | Holiday week indicator (0/1) |
| `Temperature` | float64 | Average temperature (°F) |
| `Fuel_Price` | float64 | Regional fuel price ($) |
| `CPI` | int64 | Consumer Price Index |
| `Unemployment` | float64 | Regional unemployment rate (%) |
